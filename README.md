# Pacman [JavaScript game]

Just did some practice on html canvas, learned how canvas works, learned how to draw an object inside a canvas, learned on how to make a simple game using JavaScript.

I just followed this tutorial -> [Pacman Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IMXpp3rohQ&t) I highly recommend watching the video if you want to try :D
